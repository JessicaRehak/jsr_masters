% Introduction
The Serpent 2 Monte Carlo code uses a combination of \todo{maybe
  replace with ``algorithms''} ray tracing and
delta-tracking to simulate the propagation of particles. The \gls{wdt}
method modifies delta-tracking for an absorbing medium, replacing virtual
collisions with a weight reduction. In this section, we will describe
these neutral particle propagation methods, derive an extension of \wdt{} to
include scattering, and discuss how these methods are implemented in
Serpent 2.

\section{Particle Propagation Methods}
\label{sec:propagation}

As a particle moves through a medium, multiple forces and events will
affect its trajectory. we will consider neutral elementary particles,
neutrons, so that the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic
force are negligible. It is therefore a good assumption that a neutron
will travel in a straight line until a physical collision with another
particle. Despite the large amount of neutrons present in our
simulation, we will ignore improbable collisions between neutrons
themselves. Neutron collisions with atoms results in an array of
effects, including absorption and scattering. The relative probability
of a collision occurring, and the resulting type of collision are
dependent on atom that the neutron collides with and the energy of the
neutron. Modeling the propagation of neutrons is accomplished through
a variety of algorithms, some of which we described in this section.

\subsection{Ray Tracing}
\label{sec:ray_tracing}

The basic algorithm for simulating particle transport using Monte Carlo is
ray tracing. This method follows a particle from collision to
collision, assuming that it travels in a straight, statistically
sampled path. Material properties determine the distance between
collisions, and therefore material boundaries must be considered explicitly.

Particles propagating through a material have an interaction
probability characterized by the material's experimentally determined
total-cross section, a function of position and the incident neutron
energy, $\Sigma_t(\mathbf{r}, E)$. The probability of an interaction
occurring in a differential distance traveled $ds$ is related to the
\todo{macroscopic?} cross-section:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:macroscopic}
  \frac{dP}{ds} = \Sigma_t(\mathbf{r}, E)
\end{equation}
We assume that each interaction will remove the neutron from the
incident flux, as it is absorbed or deflected out of the original path
in either position, energy, or both.  The medium therefore attenuates
an incident mono-energetic neutron flux $\phi_0$ as a function of
distance:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:attenuation}
  \phi(s) = \phi_0 e^{-s\Sigma_t(\mathbf{r})}
\end{equation}
The probability that a neutron has its first interaction in
differential distance $ds$ after
traveling a distance $s$ is found by dividing the flux at that
position $\phi(s)$ by the total flux:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PDFfunct}
  f(s)ds = \frac{\phi(s)}{\int_0^\infty\phi(s)ds}ds
\end{equation}
The basis of Eq.~\eqref{eq:PDFfunct} is clarified by an example: if
the flux after a distance $s$ is half the total flux, then half of the
neutrons have undergone an interaction.

We consider the cross-section in a single material region, where we
assume that the material is homogeneous. In this case, the
cross-section is no longer a function of position.  Using
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:attenuation} and \eqref{eq:PDFfunct}, and assuming that
the total cross-section is constant over $\mathbf{r}$\cite{lux1991}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:PDF}
  f(s)ds = \Sigma_te^{-s\Sigma_t}ds
\end{equation}
This is the \gls{pdf} of the distance
traveled before the first collision, $s$. As the distance a neutron travels
increases, the value of $f(s)$ decreases; it is less probable that a
neutron will travel further without collision. The \gls{pdf} gives us the
probability at a point $s$ that a neutron undergoes a collision
exactly there, integrating over the distance $s$ provides us the
probably that a neutron undergoes a collision between 0 and $s$. This
is the \gls{cdf}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cdf}
  F(s) = \int_0^s f(s')ds' = 1-e^{-s\Sigma_t}
\end{equation}
As expected, increasing $s$ causes the probability of any interaction,
$F(s)$, to approach unity. A plot illustrating the behavior of the
\gls{pdf} and \gls{cdf} are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cdf_pdf}. \todo{Add (a) and (b) or titles to this graph}
\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/cdf_pdf}
  \caption{Plots of the \acrshort{cdf} and \acrshort{pdf} for collision probability per distance travelled $s$.}
  \label{fig:cdf_pdf}
\end{figure}

As the \gls{cdf} ranges from zero to unity, we can sample its value by
a uniformly distributed random variable $\xi \in [0,1)$. The distance
traveled $s$, referred to as the path length, can then be expressed as
a function of this sampled random variable:
\begin{align*}
  F(s) = 1 - e^{-s\Sigma_t} &= \xi \\
  \ln(e^{-s \Sigma_t}) &= \ln(1-\xi) \\
  -\Sigma_t s &= \ln(\xi) \\
  s(\xi) &= \frac{1}{\Sigma_t}\ln(\xi)
\end{align*}

After sampling the path length of the neutron, its position is
updated, based on its original position and direction. We assumed that
the cross-section $\Sigma_t$ was constant in a material region, so the
sampled path length is only valid as long as the neutron remains in
that region.  If the neutron reaches the boundary between two material
regions, a new path length must be sampled using the cross-section of
the region it is entering. Each time a path length is sampled, the
distance to the nearest boundary in the direction of motion is
determined, and the neutron is moved to the boundary and path length
is resampled if appropriate. This can become computationally expensive
in complicated geometries and when the probability of crossing
boundaries with each sample path length is high.

\section{Woodcock Delta-tracking}
\label{sec:delta-tracking}

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ray_tracing}, the value of $\Sigma_t$
at a given position depends on the material at that point. Therefore,
$\Sigma_t(\vec{r})$ is a piece-wise discontinuous function that varies
arbitrarily with position and the geometry of the
problem~\cite{leppanen2013}. Using the ray tracing method, neutrons
must stop at boundaries to sample a new path length in a new material
region. To avoid the computational inefficiency that arises in
geometrically complicated regions, a rejection sampling technique
known as Woodcock delta-tracking was developed~\cite{woodcock1965}.

Woodcock delta-tracking introduces the concept of the majorant
cross-section, chosen to be the maximum of all material total
cross-sections in the region of interest.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:majorant}
  \Sigma_\mathrm{maj} \equiv \max_{\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{V}}\{\Sigma_t(\mathbf{r})\}
\end{equation}
Where $\mathbb{V}$ is the volume of interest, as shown in a
one-dimensional region in Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_maj}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/sigma_maj}
  \caption{Total cross-section as a function of position in one
    dimension. The majorant cross-section is the largest value in the
    region of interest and determines the probability of a real collision.}
  \label{fig:sigma_maj}
\end{figure}

The majorant
cross-section can also be represented as the summation of the total
cross-section and a delta cross-section:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:majorant2}
  \Sigma_\mathrm{maj} = \Sigma_\delta(\mathbf{r}) +
  \Sigma_t(\mathbf{r}), \quad\forall \vec{r} \in \mathbb{V}
\end{equation}
Following from the definition of $\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}$ in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:majorant}, the function $\Sigma_\delta(\mathbf{r})$ is
chosen such that $\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}$ is constant for the entire
region of interest. At the position \textbf{r} where the maximum value
of $\Sigma_t(\mathbf{r})$ occurs, the delta cross-section is zero.

The majorant cross-section is constant throughout the entire region of
interest, so we can treat it as a single material. Following the same derivation in
Section~\ref{sec:ray_tracing}, the \gls{pdf} of the first collision occurring after
$s$ in the region of interest using the majorant cross-section is given by:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:majorantpdf}
  f_\mathrm{maj}(s) &= \Sigma_\mathrm{maj}e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s} \\
  & = (\Sigma_\delta(\mathbf{r}) +
    \Sigma_t(\mathbf{r}))e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s}
\end{align}

In most of the region of interest, the majorant cross-section is not
the real cross-section. We must use a technique called rejection
sampling\todo{what is sampling} to simulate sampling the real $\Sigma_t(\vec{r})$ while
actually sampling using $\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}$. 

\subsubsection{Rejection Sampling}
\label{sec:rejection_sampling}
As described by Lux and
Koblinger~\cite{lux1991}, rejection sampling requires a \gls{pdf} of
interest, $f(x)$, and a second \gls{pdf} $g(x)$ for which:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Mleq}
  f(x) \leq M\cdot g(x), \forall x
\end{equation} where $M \in \mathbb{R}$ is a constant.
Sampling from $M\cdot g(x)$ and accepting these samples with probability:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:preal}
  P = \frac{f(x)}{M\cdot g(x)}
\end{equation}
replicates sampling directly from $f(x)$. 

For example, consider a
\gls{pdf} of interest $f(x) = x^2$ on the interval $x \in (0,1]$ as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:circle_square}.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/circle}
  \caption{Example \acrshort{pdf} function $f(x)$.}
  \label{fig:circle_square}
\end{figure}
As described in the previous section, we could sample $f(x)$ using the
\gls{cdf} $F(x)$ found by integrating and then inverting. Instead, we can sample from a
different \gls{pdf} that is always majorant of $f(x)$, as defined in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:Mleq}. We can choose $g(x) = 1$, as $f(x) \leq 1$ on
the interval of interest. The \gls{cdf} of $g(x)$ is easy to
determine, because it is a constant value, and is just $G(x) =
x$. Therefore, we can sample $g(x)$ by simply sampling a random value $\xi
\in (0,1]$ and taking this as the value of $x$. To replicate sampling
from $f(x)$, we then sample another random value $\xi_2 \in (0,1]$ and
accept our value of $x$ using the probability defined in Eq.~\eqref{eq:preal}:
\begin{equation*}
  \xi_2 \leq \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = x^2
\end{equation*}
Following this algorithm using the simple Matlab script:
\begin{lstlisting}
a = [];                     % Accepted samples
for i = 1:1000
    x = rand;               % Sample g(x)
    y = rand;               % Gen random number xi2
    if y <= x.^2            % If xi2 <= f(x)/g(x)
        a(end+1) = x;       % Accept sample
    end
end
\end{lstlisting}
Generates the histogram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdf_histogram}. As
expected, the procedure has reproduced the desired \gls{pdf} of $f(x)
= x^2$. Although this requires sampling two random variables, it can be
advantageous if $F(x)$ is difficult or impossible to invert.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/pdf_histogram}
  \caption{Histogram of results from sampling and applying the
    rejection sampling algorithm.}
  \label{fig:pdf_histogram}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Application to Delta-tracking}
\label{sec:application_to_delta-tracking}

As we saw in Fig.~\ref{fig:sigma_maj}, the total cross-section
$\Sigma_t$ is a piecewise discontinuous function that depends on the
geometry of our problem. Therefore, each region has a different
\gls{cdf} for sampling path length, and described in
Section~\ref{sec:ray_tracing}. Using rejection sampling, we can sample
the real collision \gls{pdf}, using a different, simpler \gls{pdf}.
In Woodcock delta tracking, the second \gls{pdf} $g(x)$ is chosen to
be the majorant \gls{pdf}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:majorantpdf}. This is
beneficial because the majorant cross-section is constant over the
entire region.

These functions are both maximized at $x=0$, where the inequality of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:Mleq} is satisfied by setting $M=1$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:cseq}
  \Sigma_t(\mathbf{r}) \leq \Sigma_\mathrm{maj}(\mathbf{r}), \forall
  \mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{V}
\end{equation}
We sample path length using the constant majorant
cross-section:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:majorantsample}
  s_\mathrm{maj}(\xi) = -\frac{1}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}}\ln(\xi)
\end{equation}
Which samples the \gls{pdf} defined in Eq.\eqref{eq:majorant}:
\begin{align*}
    f_\mathrm{maj}(s) &= \Sigma_\mathrm{maj}e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s} \\
  & = (\Sigma_\delta(\mathbf{r}) +
    \Sigma_t(\mathbf{r}))e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s}
\end{align*}
We can see that this \gls{pdf} is the sum of two different ones: one
representing actual collisions based on the real total cross-section
$\Sigma_t$ and one representing the non-physical collisions based on
$\Sigma_\delta$. We call these non-physical collisions ``virtual''
collisions, and these should be eliminated by our rejection
sampling. To apply rejection sampling, we therefore pick the \gls{pdf}
we want to sample $f(x)$ and the \gls{pdf} we will actually sample
$g(x)$ as such:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &= \Sigma_t(\vec{r})e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s} \\
  g(x) &= \Sigma_\mathrm{maj}e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s}
\end{align*}
We will therefore accept samples with the probability given
in Eq.~\eqref{eq:preal}:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:prealfinal}
  P_{\mathrm{real}}(\vec{r}) &= \frac{f(x)}{Mg(x)} =
      \frac{\Sigma_t(\mathbf{r})e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s}}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}e^{-\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}s}}
  = \frac{\Sigma_t(\mathbf{r})}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}}
\end{align}
We will refer to this as the probability of a ``real'' collision,
$P_\mathrm{real}$ to differentiate these physical collisions from the
non-physical virtual collisions. It is important to note that the
probability is independent of path length $s$, but is dependent on
position $\vec{r}$. At each collision, the material region at the
neutron position must be determined, but we do not need to explicitly
track boundaries nor calculate their distance each time a path length
is sampled. The algorithm for delta-tracking is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:dt}.

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Delta-tracking}\label{alg:dt}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \State \textbf{Sample} path length

  \State \textbf{Look up} location to get $\Sigma_t(\vec{r})$
  \State $P_\mathrm{real} \gets
  \frac{\Sigma_t(\vec{r})}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}}$
  \State \textbf{Sample} random number $\xi \in [0,1)$
  \If{$\xi < P_\mathrm{real}$} \Comment{Collision is real}
  \State \textbf{Execute} real collision
    \Else \Comment{Collision is virtual}
    \State \textbf{Execute} virtual collision
  \EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/dt}
  \caption{Delta-tracking algorithm and flow chart.}
  \label{fig:dt}
\end{figure}

Now, the path length can be sampled across multiple material regions
of varying $\Sigma_t$ without explicitly stopping the neutron at a
given boundary. This method can become computationally inefficient in
regions where the total cross-section is much less than the majorant
cross-section, leading to oversampling of virtual collisions. This is
seen in geometries that include localized absorbers, such as control
rods. Another downside is that the \gls{tle} for
flux cannot be used. The \gls{tle} requires calculating the track-lengths
within a particular material cell, and therefore does not work when
the neutron path length can cross one or more material
boundaries. The \gls{cfe} can be used in its
place, but often results in inferior statistics as not every track
length sampled ends in a collision~\cite{leppanen2013}.

\subsubsection{Nonuniform Density Distributions}
\label{sec:nonuniform}

Rejection sampling can also be used when the total cross-section is
not constant within a material region. As discussed by
Lepp\"{a}nen~\cite{leppanen2013}, Serpent 2 conducts a rejection
sampling routine similar to Woodcock delta-tracking in these
regions. Instead of sampling from a majorant cross-section across
multiple materials, a maximum cross-section for the single material
region is used. Unlike delta-tracking, this requires stopping the
neutron at boundaries and resampling path lengths. This algorithm is
not modified by the implementation of \gls{wdt} and none of the input
files used to assess \gls{wdt} use this feature.

\section{\Acrlong{wdt}}
\label{sec:wdt}

Morgan and Kotlyar~\cite{morgan2015} introduced a method to improve the
inefficiencies of Woodcock delta-tracking in the presence of large
absorbers. The method, \gls{wdt}, replaces the
rejection sampling algorithm of delta-tracking with a weight reduction
algorithm. This process is similar to survival biasing, or implicit capture.

\subsection{Implicit Statistical Events}
\label{sec:implicit}

We consider a process that can result in multiple outcomes, each with
their own probability. One approach is to sample a random variable and
determine which outcome actually occurred. If the event occurs many
times, we can instead replace the
statistical process by using the expected value of the random process
\cite{lux1991}. The expected value of a random variable $x$ that can
take values ${x_1 \ldots x_n}$ with  probabilities ${p_1 \ldots p_n}$, respectively,
is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expval}
  E[x] = x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 \ldots + x_{n}p_n
\end{equation}
For example, imagine we have a bag with four coins, three worth \$0.25 and
one worth \$0.10. The values and their probabilities are:
\begin{align*}
  x_1 = 0.25, \quad p_1 = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \\
  x_2 = 0.10, \quad p_2 = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
\end{align*}
For a given draw, we could sample a random value and use the
probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ to determine the coin drawn. Or, we can
describe the expected value of the drawn coin:
\begin{align*}
  E[x] &= x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 \\
  &= (0.25 \times 0.75) + (0.10 \times 0.25) \\
  &= 0.2125
\end{align*}
This value represents the average value of a coin drawn, if we perform
many draws. The following Matlab code replicates this procedure:
\begin{lstlisting}
v = 0;
n = 1000;
for i = 1:n
    xi = rand;  
    v = v + (xi < 0.25)*0.1 + (xi >= 0.25)*0.25;
end
\end{lstlisting}
Although the exact values will vary due to the small sample size, \verb|v/n|
$\approx 0.2125$, as we expected.

This framework is often applied to neutron propagation in a process
called ``survival biasing.'' At each collision location, the type of
interaction is sampled and the appropriate action taken. In the case
of an capture event the neutron is ``killed,'' removed from the
simulation. While this accurately reflects the physical reality, it
does not produce good statistics. Assuming we are using a collision
estimator, the neutron's contribution to our simulation is the history
of collisions. Each of these provide a score to that particular
collision, contributing to the overall simulation
statistics. Capture events that kill neutrons, therefore, are
removing the very particles we need to generate better statistics,
resulting in the need for many more particles. Mitigating this issue
is the goal of survival biasing.

Survival biasing avoids killing neutrons by replacing capture
events with an expected outcome. As described above, we do not need to
track the outcome of every single event, but can rely on the expected
value. This will give us, on average, the outcome of our many
events. To eliminate our explicit consideration of capture events,
we therefore have two possible event types: capture events, and
scattering events. The probabilities $p$ will be given by the
ratios of the cross-sections:
\begin{align*}
  p_{\mathrm{capture}} = \frac{\Sigma_{a}}{\Sigma_t} \\
  p_{\mathrm{scattering}} = \frac{\Sigma_{s}}{\Sigma_t}
\end{align*}
Where $\Sigma_{a}$ and $\Sigma_{s}$ are the macroscopic cross-sections
for capture \todo{make capture/absorption consistent} and scattering, respectively.

In the coin example, each had a different monetary value, giving us an
expected value when we drew many times. We must introduce something
similar for neutrons. It is convention to call this intrinsic value
``weight'' and represents the importance of the neutron. All neutrons
are born with the same weight, usually unity, and are killed when they
have zero weight. By that convention a capture event that kills a
neutron immediately forces the final weight of the neutron to zero,
$w_{f,\mathrm{capture}} = 0$. We can then calculate the expected
value of the interaction of a neutron with initial weight $w_i$:
\begin{align*}
  E[w_f] &= w_{f,\mathrm{scattering}}p_\mathrm{scattering} +
           w_{f,\mathrm{capture}}p_\mathrm{capture} \\
  &= w_{f,\mathrm{scattering}}p_\mathrm{scattering}
\end{align*}
A scattering event merely changes the location of the neutron in
energy and angle phase space, leaving its importance
unchanged. Therefore, $w_{f,\mathrm{scattering}} = w_i$:
\begin{align*}
  E[w_f] = w_ip_\mathrm{scattering} 
\end{align*}
Now every collision is considered to be a non-capture event. The
neutron continues with a lower weight, proportional to the probability
that the event was scattering. The weight lost in the collision is
scored as capture:
\begin{align*}
  S_\mathrm{capture} &= E[w_i - w_f] \\
  &= E[w_i] - E[w_f] \\
&= w_i - w_ip_\mathrm{scattering} \\
&= w_i(1-p_\mathrm{scattering})
\end{align*}
A similar method will be used by weighted delta-tracking.

\subsection{Russian Rouletting}
\label{sec:rouletting}

When the survival biasing routine described in Sec.~\ref{sec:implicit}
is used, the loss of neutrons is entirely reliant on leakage from the
problem or fission events. Neutrons will continue to undergo
collisions and subsequent weight reduction until they have a very low
weight. These particles will only contribute small amounts to our
statistics, so tracking them is computationally inefficient.  To
mitigate this, a lower cutoff for the weight is introduced. Once
neutrons are below this weight, they have a chance of being killed by
a Russian Rouletting routine. The general algorithm is shown in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:roulette}.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Rouletting Routine}\label{alg:roulette}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If{weight $<$ weight threshold}
   \State $\xi \gets $ random number $\in [0,1)$
   \If{$\xi < $ roulette probability}
     \State Kill particle
   \Else
     \State $w_f \gets w_i$/(roulette probability) \label{inc}
   \EndIf
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Following a collision, if the weight of the colliding particle is
below a defined weight threshold, a random number is sampled. If this
number is below a defined rouletting probability, the particle is
killed. If the particle survives rouletting, its weight is increased
proportional to the rouletting probability. By killing low weight
particles, or increasing their weight, the inefficiency of tracking
low-weight particles can be reduced.

\subsection{\Acrlong{wdt}}
\label{sec:wdttheory}

Morgan and Kotlyar~\cite{morgan2015} introduced a method to improve
the inefficiencies of Woodcock delta-tracking in the presence of large
absorbers. The method, \gls{wdt}, replaces the rejection sampling of
delta-tracking with a weight reduction. This is similar to the process
of implicit capture discussed in Section~\ref{sec:implicit}.

The \gls{wdt} method samples the particle path length in the same fashion as
Woodcock delta-tracking. As described in Section~\ref{sec:delta-tracking},
after each path length sampled, the delta-tracking method accepts the
collision as real with the probability shown in
Eq.~\ref{eq:preal}. The \gls{wdt} method bypasses this rejection sampling by
accepting all collisions as real with a subsequent reduction in
weight. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:implicit}, replacing a
statistical event requires calculation of the expectated value. In
this case, the two events are a real collision and a virtual
collision.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wdtexpected}
  E[w_f] = w_{f,\mathrm{real}}P_{\mathrm{real}} + w_{f,\mathrm{virt}}P_{\mathrm{virt}}
\end{equation}
Morgan and Kotlyar examine a 1D test case with absorption. As an
absorption event removes the particle, the resulting final weight of a
real collision is zero. A virtual collision is rejected, and therefore
leaves the weight unchanged. Inserting the appropriate values into
Eq.~\eqref{eq:wdtexpected} gives the expected value of the final
weight for an absorption event.
\begin{align*}
  \label{eq:mkexpected}
  E[w_f] &= w_{f,\mathrm{real}}P_{\mathrm{real}} +
           w_{f,\mathrm{virt}}P_{\mathrm{virt}} \\
  &= 0 + w_iP_{\mathrm{virt}} \\
  &= w_i(1-P_\mathrm{real}) \\
  &= w_i\left(1-\frac{\Sigma_t}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}}\right)
\end{align*}
The particle that is left following the collsion continues propegating
as if it underwent a virtual collision. In this case, the absorption
is then scored using the expectation value of the score.
\begin{align*}
  S_\mathrm{absorption} &= E[w_i - w_f] \\
  &= E[w_i] - E[w_f] \\
  &= w_i\left(\frac{\Sigma_t}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}}\right)
\end{align*}
This is implemented by Kotlyar and Morgan in a 1D problem and the
results are verified with the analytical solution. The authors point
out that a rouletting routine should be implemented when this is used,
to prevent the tracking of low-weight neutrons.

\section{\Acrlong{wdt} with scattering}
\label{sec:wdt_scattering}


In a scattering event, the weight of the incident particle does not
change. Therefore, application of the expectation value as in
Section~\ref{sec:wdttheory} results in an expected value of the final
weight equal to the initial weight.
\begin{align*}
  E[w_f] &= w_{f,\mathrm{real}}P_{\mathrm{real}} +
           w_{f,\mathrm{virt}}P_{\mathrm{virt}} \\
  &= w_iP_\mathrm{real} + w_iP_{\mathrm{virt}} \\
  &= w_i(P_\mathrm{real} + 1 -P_\mathrm{real}) \\
  &= w_i
\end{align*}

This doesn't model what we expect. We can view \gls{wdt} as splitting
the weighted neutron into two particles. One carries the real portion
of the weight and experiences the collision. The other carries the
virtual portion of the weight and continues propagating as if no
collision occurred. This works fine for absorption, where the portion
that experiences the collision does not propagate, it is immediately
killed and scored. But, when the neutron is split into a scattering
portion and a virtual portion, no weight is lost because neither of
those events change the weight.

Therefore, extension of this methodology to scattering requires duplication of
the particle at the point of collsion. The virtual portion of the
weight is carried away by a particle that propagates as if no
collision has occured, and the real portion is carried away by a
particle that undergoes scattering. In problems with scattering, this
results in a rapid multiplication of neutrons. When implemented into
Serpent 2, this multiplication very quickly filled any available
neutron buffer in simulations of a \gls{bwr}, ending
the simulation. Another method for handling scattering events must be

\subsection{Scattering Rejection Sampling}
\label{sec:scattering}

As described in the last section, the \gls{wdt} method may result in
an intractable simulation when applied to scattering. To maintain
proper statistics, scattering must take into account the possibility
of a virtual collision while using delta-tracking. To achieve this
goal, the delta-tracking rejection sampling that had been supplanted
by \gls{wdt} was moved into the scattering subroutine. Therefore, the
new routine uses both rejection-sampling and implicit events to
account for the possibility of real and virtual collisions. The
algorithm is shown in Alg.~\ref{alg:scattalg} and a flow chart of the
routine is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:wdt}

    \State \textbf{Score} capture or fission $\gets
    w_iP_\mathrm{real}$
    \State \textbf{Score} collision  $\gets w_iP_\mathrm{real}$
    \State $w_f \gets w_i(1-P_\mathrm{real})$
    \State \textbf{Execute} virtual collision
  \Else
    \State \textbf{Sample} random number $\xi \in [0,1)$
    \If{$\xi < P_\mathrm{real}$} \Comment{Collision is real}
    \State \textbf{Score} scattering $\gets w_i$
    \State \textbf{Score} collision $\gets w_i$
      \State \textbf{Execute} scattering collision
    \Else \Comment{Collision is virtual}
    \State \textbf{Execute} virtual collision
    \EndIf
  \EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Note that there are two separate scoring events in each collision
subroutine: scoring of the actual collision type for calculating
specific reaction rates, and scoring of collision itself used by the
collision flux estimator. In addition, scoring the fission reaction
also encompasses generation of fission neutrons.

In the original delta-tracking routine, the rejection sampling takes
place prior to collision type sampling, and collision scoring can
occur between the two. This is the routine that Serpent 2 used, prior
to modification for the above scheme. By moving the rejection sampling
after the collision type sampling, the collision score is no longer
agnostic of the type of collision that will occur. Therefore, in the
implementation of this routine in Serpent 2, the collision scoring was
moved after the collision type sampling.

\section{Implementation in Serpent 2}
\label{sec:implementation}

The Serpent 2 Monte Carlo Code uses a combination of surface tracking,
Woodcock delta-tracking, and rejection sampling for non-uniform
density distributions. Serpent 2 selects between surface tracking and
delta-tracking by examining the ratio of total cross-section to
majorant cross-section~\cite{leppanen2010}. In regions where many
virtual collisions would occur, the code preferentially switches to
ray tracing. This is to avoid the computational inefficiency of
processing virtual collisions that provide no statistics. This selection
determined by a constant $c$ and the inequality in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:s2deltasurface}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:s2deltasurface}
  \frac{\Sigma_t(\vec{r})}{\Sigma_\mathrm{maj}} > 1 - c
\end{equation}
If this inequality is true, delta-tracking is used, otherwise
ray-tracing (referred to as surface-tracking in Serpent 2) is used. By
default, the value of $c$ is 0.9, as this was determined to produce
the best improvement in run time~\cite{leppanen2010}. We note that
this inequality is identical to the value of $P_\mathrm{real}$, and
this scheme is summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:ray_wdt_normal}.  Prior to
sampling path length, the code tests this ratio for the current
neutron position and determines if surface tracking or delta-tracking
should be used. If delta-tracking is used, the code then determines if
the collision is virtual or real. The value of $c$ can be set in the
input file using \verb|set dt|.

\subsection{Weighted delta-tracking threshold}
\label{sec:wdt_thresh}

\gls{wdt} is designed to improve the effectiveness of
delta-tracking when the change of a virtual collision is
high. We can hypothesize that the algorithm will benefit in
the regime where $P_{\mathrm{real}}$ is low. At high values of
$P_{\mathrm{real}}$, a majority of the weight of the incoming particle
is scored. This leaves the particle that undergoes a virtual
collision with a very low weight, relying on the rouletting routine to
prevent causing computational inefficiency. These two situations
imply that there is a region between low and high values of
$P_\mathrm{real}$ where \gls{wdt} may provide benefit.

A new input parameter line \verb|set wdt| is used to indicate that
\gls{wdt} is to be used, and can also set the value of the \gls{wdt}
threshold $t_{\mathrm{wdt}}$. This is the ratio below which \gls{wdt} will be used. This
scheme is summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:ray_wdt}.
